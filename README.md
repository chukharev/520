# 520 Computational Analysis of English

**Version:** Spring 2024

**Catalog description:** Concepts and practices for analysis of English by computer with emphasis on the applications of computational analysis to problems in applied linguistics such as corpus analysis and recognition of learner language in computer-assisted learning and language assessment.

**Note about computer programming:** This is not a programming class. Focused instruction in computer programming is not part of the learning experience in this class. However, a working knowledge of a programming language is expected from students who are taking this class, and developing computer programs is highly encouraged for the best outcomes of project-based learning.

## Major topics:

**Topic 1. Word and sentence tokenization: The first step in most computational analysis tasks (Weeks 1-2)**

Learning outcomes:

- define the task of computational analysis (as a specific example, research orthographic signals of sentence boundaries)
- develop a set of regular expressions for a rule-based sentence tokenzier for English

Assessment: participation points (5 max). Participation will be assessed holistically based on the following criteria:
- consistency of preparation for class (completion of assigned readings and other homework)
- meaningful participation in in-class discussions and activities
- substantive contribution to group work on task definition and system development
- evidence of the ability to synthesize prior linguistic knowledge for the development of the computational system

**Topic 2. Evaluation of computational approaches to language analysis (Weeks 3-4)**

Learning outcomes:

- manually annotate a gold-standard corpus for system evaluation
- calculate, interpret, and report inter-annotator reliability using Krippendorff's alpha
- calculate, interpret, and report standard performance metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score) of the system

Assessment: a two-page write-up about the implementation and evaluation of the tokenizer (Methods and Results sections) - 30 points max, according to the following rubric:
- precise, succinct and reproducible description of the methods - 10 points
- clear, accurate and unbiased presentation of the results - 10 points
- correct calculation of the reliability index and the system performance metrics - 10 points

**Topic 3. Computational analysis of English spelling: editing distance (Weeks 5-6)**

Learning outcomes:

- explain and use the method of dynamic programming for combinatory optimization
- implement the calculation of Levenshtein distance between two strings

Assessment: an in-class quiz to demonstrate the understanding of dynamic programming - 5 points max. Rubric will be provided on the quiz.

**Topic 4. Computational analysis of English morphology: implementations and applications of stemming and POS tagging (Weeks 7-8)**

Readings:
 - Porter Stemmer (TBD)
 - Viterbi Algorithm (TBD)

Learning outcomes:

- implement a rule-based Porter stemmer using regular expressions
- explain and use the Viterbi algorithm for POS tagging

Assessment: participation points (10 max). Participation will be assessed holistically based on the following criteria:
- consistency of preparation for class, meaningful participation in in-class activities
- substantive contribution to group work on the development of a rule-based stemmer and a POS tagger
- evidence of the ability to synthesize prior linguistic knowledge for the development of the computational systems

**Topic 5. Computational analysis of English syntax: post-processing syntactic-parse information (Weeks 9-10)**

Learning outcomes:

- understand computational representations of syntactic structures
- computationally process syntactic-parse information

Assessment: participation points (10 max). Participation will be assessed holistically based on the following criteria:
- consistency of preparation for class, meaningful participation in in-class activities
- substantive contribution to group work on post-processing syntactic-parse information

**Topic 6. Computational analysis of English semantics: WordNet and embeddings (Weeks 11-12)**

Learning outcomes:

- understand computational representations of meaning
- computationally process semantic information using WordNet and embeddings

Assessment: participation points (10 max). Participation will be assessed holistically based on the following criteria:
- consistency of preparation for class, meaningful participation in in-class activities
- substantive contribution to group work on computational semantics

**Personal Project (Weeks 13-15)**

Possible directions for the personal project include:
 - a corpus-based empirical research study
 - development of an automated writing evaluation tool/grammar checker
 - a natural-language understanding module for a (spoken) dialog system

The project must use at least one of the following:
 - post-processing of syntactic parse information
 - computational analysis of natural language semantics

Assessment: a short paper documenting the final project - 30 points max, according to the following rubric:
- clear and effective delivery of the Introduction section - 5 points
- precise, succinct and reproducible description of methodology - 10 points
- clear, accurate and unbiased presentation of results (empirical findings or system evaluation) - 10 points
- discussion of findings within the broader context of research in applied linguistics - 5 points

**Note: There will be no final exam.**

**Grading scale:** 930	=> A, 900	=> A-, 870	=> B+, 830	=> B, etc.
